Welcome to Glide, the ride-sharing app that makes your travel experience effortless and eco-friendly!

## Overview

**Effortless Booking:** Glide provides a user-friendly interface for quick and easy ride bookings, making traveling easy and economical while reducing fuel emissions.

**Empowering Drivers:** For those looking to drive, Glide offers a platform to list rides, giving drivers control over their schedules and fostering meaningful connections with passengers. It also helps them save up on expenses and potentially make some money.

## App Walkthrough
Here are some of the features we have worked on:

### Task 1: Finding a Ride

User enters their location and desired destination, which brings up a list of available rides matching their criteria. The interface prominently displays key information such as ride duration, cost, and driver details for easy comparison.

### Task 2: Booking and Confirming Ride

After selecting a ride, the user can review and confirm the details. They can then proceed to book the ride through a simple booking interface. There is a safety tips tab on every screen to ensure our users feel safe at all times.

### Task 3: Live Status Updates

Once the ride is booked, the user accesses live status update features showing the driver's status with the ride. The driver can update the status when progressing with the trip.

### Task 4: Adding/Editing/Deleting Rides

Drivers can add a new ride by filling out a form in the app with details like departure time, route, number of available seats, and price. The interface allows drivers to view and manage their listed rides, offering options to edit details or delete rides that are no longer available.

### Task 5: Checking Accepted Rides and Talking to Passengers

The driverâ€™s dashboard displays a list of all booked rides and scheduled times. A built-in messaging feature enables drivers to directly communicate with passengers for any coordination or to provide updates regarding the ride.
